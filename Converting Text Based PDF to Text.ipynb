    "# Case Study – Information Extraction From PDF\n",
    "An Insurance Company wants to digitize their legacy data. Most of the data are captured in the form of text which is available as a portable document format(pdf). The company wants to extract information and then export the required information in the form of CSV so that it can be loaded into the database easily.\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we assume that we have only one pdf which is stored here for your reference. It is assumed that the PDFs are text-based and not image scanned PDFs. For simplicity, we are going to extract the following information from pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Master Policy No.**\n",

    "**Certificate No.**\n",

    "**Steps Involved In This Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Convert PDF to text** – In this step, we need to convert the PDF file to a text string. This can be achieved via python packages like pdfminer.six or PyPDF2. In the code example for this tutorial, I have used PyPDF2. Please note that this process extracts texts only from text-based PDFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Extract Information from Text** – Once the text data is available, the next step is to find the required fields. This can be found with the help of regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Reformat and Extract**– After the required information is extracted and stored. This step ensures that the information is stored in such a way so as to make the data interpretable and easy to extract. This can be done with the help of pandas library of python. "
